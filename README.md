# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

One feature that I'd like to implement on a future project would be the use of different iframes and widgets. We learned how to created maps, books, music, etc in the teachings but implementing them into the projects would be seomthing I look forward to.
